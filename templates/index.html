        <p class="lead text-muted text-justify">A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is a discussion or informational website
            published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).
            Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first,
            at the top of the web page. 'Blog' and 'blogging' are now loosely used for content creation and sharing on
            social media, especially when the content is long-form and one creates and shares content on regular basis.</p>
