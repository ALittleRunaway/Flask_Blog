        <div class="text-justify">
  <p class="lead text-muted">The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger[9] on December 17, 1997. The short form,
      "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar
      of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999. Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as
      both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the
      term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.</p>
  <p class="lead text-muted">Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms including Usenet,
      commercial online services such as GEnie, Byte Information Exchange (BIX) and the early CompuServe, e-mail
      and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS). In the 1990s, Internet forum software created running conversations with
      "threads". Threads are topical connections between messages on a virtual "corkboard". From June 14, 1993,
      Mosaic Communications Corporation maintained their "What's New" list of new websites, updated daily and
      archived monthly. The page was accessible by a special "What's New" button in the Mosaic web browser.</p>
  <p class="lead text-muted">The earliest instance of a commercial blog was on the first business to consumer Web
      site created in 1995 by Ty, Inc., which featured a blog in a section called "Online Diary". The entries were
      maintained by featured Beanie Babies that were voted for monthly by Web site visitors.</p>
  <p class="lead text-muted">The modern blog evolved from the online diary where people would keep a running account
      of the events in their personal lives. Most such writers called themselves diarists, journalists, or journalers.
      Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 while a student at Swarthmore College, is generally recognized
      as one of the earlier bloggers, as is Jerry Pournelle. Dave Winer's Scripting News is also credited with
      being one of the older and longer running weblogs. The Australian Netguide magazine maintained the Daily
      Net News on their web site from 1996. Daily Net News ran links and daily reviews of new websites, mostly in
      Australia.</p>
